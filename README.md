# Rosalind Solutions

Hi there! Welcome to my little corner of the internet, where I tackle bioinformatics challenges from Rosalind. This is where I combine my love for genomics and coding into neat, reproducible solutions.

## About Me
I’m Shogan, a bioinformatics enthusiast currently pursuing my master’s at Northeastern University. I love exploring how biology and data intersect to solve complex problems. My approach? No hardcoding here—my scripts adapt to any input file so you can easily reuse them on your datasets.

## What’s Inside?
- **src/**: All my solution scripts live here.
- **sample_input/**: Curious how the scripts work? Check out these example input files to test them out.

## Reproducibility
I’m all about keeping things simple and reliable. These solutions are designed to handle input files from the `sample_input` folder without you needing to tweak anything manually. Plug and play—and it’ll just work.

## Collaboration
I’m currently building out unit tests for these scripts. If you’re a fellow coder (or just interested), I’d love for you to join in and collaborate! Testing is where the magic happens, so let’s make these solutions even better together.

Let’s make bioinformatics fun and approachable!
